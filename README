App should edit a list of Tasks.

Tasks have two attributes:  Name and Priority
And one computed attribute:  Abbreviation  (the first letter of each word)

Main view is a list of tasks.  Has a filter box above that live filters the list by name.

If possible (in this priority order):
   1) delete items
   2) auto-sync to a firebase backend
   3) sort the items
